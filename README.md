# Instagram-Feed
The goal is to create a dynamic and responsive feed that demonstrates your ability to handle mixed media, optimize scrolling performance, and implement proper caching strategies. Task Requirements


- Swift UI + MVVM 
- Create a ImageCacheManager : using NSCache.

✅ Super smooth scrolling.

✅ No reloading images when coming back to same cell.

✅ Great memory management (because NSCache auto-removes images if memory low).

✅ Better user experience (especially when list becomes large).
